1. Create a 16x16 grid of square divs (will have a size of 960px x 960px --make them fit within that space)
    a. I'm thinking that we do this with js using the createElement() 
    b. place these divs in a another div that has the 'container' class
    c. for now I'll use flexbox (i.e. display: flex)
    d. be wary of margins, padding, and border size as they can affect the size of the squares


2. Check for the hover event so that if a mouse were to hover over a div, it will be colored
    a. change the color by getting reference to the div.style.background-color = 'color';

3. A button should be added to clear out the sketch then the user will be asked to declare the grid size (max of 100). 

4. (optional) instead of just having the only colors be black and white, make it random and each iteration leading up to the 10th color will be fully black. 
    a. I assume that we just update the rgb values to decrease by 10% of their value until it reaches (0, 0 , 0);
